3/19/22, 5:39 PM - AmineF0: Anyway I'm gonna leave to the "hammam" , I have accumulated a lot of stress in last 3 days , ended up hacking my own phone and installing a specific version of Android then fixing my computer, my head hurts ...
3/19/22, 5:51 PM - namoWonder: You are amazing hhhhhhhhh but sure go ahead even tho I have no idea how tf you hacked it
3/19/22, 9:20 PM - AmineF0: It was not really hard , just confusing complicated, risky and maybe  illegal hhh
3/19/22, 9:20 PM - AmineF0: I assume u re still in the long boring road
3/19/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: I'm in with illegal hhhhhhh
3/19/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: What road

3/19/22, 9:23 PM - namoWonder: And imma be in my hotel till midnight idk how ill get there but i will
3/19/22, 9:23 PM - namoWonder: Hhhhhhhhhhhhh don't judge me
3/19/22, 9:23 PM - AmineF0: Hhh I'm not , u re just out of my realm of understanding
3/19/22, 9:23 PM - AmineF0: Good for u I suppose
3/19/22, 9:25 PM - namoWonder: Well im still in taxi so yeah I will be safe soon
3/19/22, 9:25 PM - namoWonder: U know she gave me 3 earrings and they look like the Rocks I got you from targha
3/19/22, 9:26 PM - namoWonder: It's beautiful to see nature in jewelry
3/19/22, 9:26 PM - namoWonder: Feeling better tho after hammam ?
3/19/22, 9:26 PM - namoWonder: I think you will like moulay ya3qoub , it's good there
3/19/22, 9:28 PM - AmineF0: I don't know how u find these people, it shows how good u re with people
3/19/22, 9:29 PM - AmineF0: A village stack in the past hhh, his people are like from the 70's , nice people
3/19/22, 9:30 PM - AmineF0: Maybe I'm developing some heart problem , but can't deny hammam's psychological effect, energy refresher
3/19/22, 9:32 PM - namoWonder: I mean the place where there is pool jacuzzi and all not the whole place  hhhhh
3/19/22, 9:32 PM - namoWonder: You stay in the super hot area  for two long ?
3/19/22, 9:33 PM - namoWonder: They find me , all I do is asking and laughing for real
3/19/22, 9:34 PM - AmineF0: Not anymore, it's a lot of factors , my body became sensitive lately to intensive things ... But normal , I was just  exhausted for too long...
3/19/22, 9:34 PM - AmineF0: I don't understand it but good for u hhh
3/19/22, 9:36 PM - namoWonder: You have accumulation of things and you just intensively burn it in hammam ?
3/19/22, 9:38 PM - namoWonder: It's easy , laughing is a communication language, just laugh and ask them about their culture , just go wherever and try to see beauty in everything , people who try to create beauty will find you and show it you themselves
3/19/22, 9:38 PM - namoWonder: Like the lamb that was cooked by that lady is amazing i found what I was looking for , food hhhhhhhhhhh
3/19/22, 9:39 PM - AmineF0: Good to hear that u re enjoying the experience
3/19/22, 9:41 PM - AmineF0: According to my experience it does more good than bad, having a clear mind helps me focus on my body, otherwise I become frustrated and start neglecting things... Which leaded where I am now so ... I'm slowly recovering... Maybe hhh ?
3/19/22, 9:43 PM - namoWonder: What makes you thing you're developing a hearts problem then
3/19/22, 9:44 PM - AmineF0: It hurts hhh and it's uncomfortable, and I'm becoming more sensitive...
3/19/22, 9:44 PM - AmineF0: But I will figure it out and it is a price I'm willing to take
3/19/22, 9:45 PM - AmineF0: Anyway, at ur hotel yet?
3/19/22, 9:45 PM - namoWonder: Are you eating well ?
3/19/22, 9:45 PM - namoWonder: Yes and showered and all done
3/19/22, 9:46 PM - AmineF0: What a woman hhh
3/19/22, 9:47 PM - namoWonder: Hhhhhhhh good to hear that
3/19/22, 9:48 PM - AmineF0: Well here's the situation nothing is perfect and greatness comes at a price, and with good tools the price can be lowered ... So it's a learning process, how to achieve a lot with damage control
3/19/22, 9:51 PM - namoWonder: You're aware it's a health damage right ?
3/19/22, 9:59 PM - AmineF0: Yeah but I can't do much , all I can do is damage control for my destructive habits and developing the constructive one
3/19/22, 10:00 PM - AmineF0: It's not that I'm not trying , it's just that there's a lot of demanding things...
3/19/22, 10:01 PM - namoWonder: Im afraid i cant agree at all
3/19/22, 10:03 PM - namoWonder: You can manage university work gym hobby and social life all at once no matter how demanding they are without having health as damage price
3/19/22, 10:04 PM - namoWonder: I can accept all damages but not health ones  from you
3/19/22, 10:05 PM - AmineF0: I will want it to be true , a d for the ordinary it probably is , but right now I don't see how
3/19/22, 10:06 PM - namoWonder: For the ordinary ?
3/19/22, 10:06 PM - namoWonder: Hel nah
3/19/22, 10:06 PM - namoWonder: Hell*
3/19/22, 10:08 PM - AmineF0: I don't know
3/19/22, 10:08 PM - AmineF0: I don't really talk about it
3/19/22, 10:09 PM - AmineF0: I was listening yesterday to a podcast explaining "la mauvaise foi " in Sartre's philosophy
3/19/22, 10:09 PM - AmineF0: Maybe denial is the exact translation, when u know the truth or suspect but refuse to believe it
3/19/22, 10:10 PM - AmineF0: Because it challenges ur perspection of urself and ur sense of identity
3/19/22, 10:11 PM - namoWonder: Isn't that what a human need ?
3/19/22, 10:11 PM - AmineF0: Yep it's natural
3/19/22, 10:12 PM - AmineF0: But being aware of it is necessary for better self understanding and improvement
3/19/22, 10:12 PM - AmineF0: It doesn't mean refusing to deny reality , it is just to be aware of u trying to deny...
3/19/22, 10:13 PM - AmineF0: And it's hard to know when u re denying and when it's true
3/19/22, 10:13 PM - namoWonder: Why would anyone try to deny
3/19/22, 10:14 PM - AmineF0: The explained the difference between a lie and "denial" but the little story if u went to someone's house and she tried her best to cook for u
3/19/22, 10:16 PM - AmineF0: The food wasn't great , and u start trying to avoid the hard question of is it good but you get asked and answer " yeah it's delicious" while u know it is not , that is a lie , u re lying but aware of the truth
3/19/22, 10:18 PM - AmineF0: Denial cones when even u re trying to convince urself of the lie. U was driving and went past the red light , and because u believe that u re righteous u start saying it is not that bad , it was just milliseconds after green , there was nobody in the road anyway , and it is an emergency I'm taking my pregnant wife to the hospital...
3/19/22, 10:20 PM - AmineF0: What was the first thing , emotion or the thought, wasn't losing ur self esteem so scary and u wanted to believe that u re right u re doing the right thing so powerful it shaped ur reality to what u wanted to believe
3/19/22, 10:20 PM - AmineF0: ...
3/19/22, 10:21 PM - AmineF0: Anyway it is interesting to contemplate when it is true what we think , and when we are trying to justify our emotions
3/19/22, 10:22 PM - AmineF0: U see someone , u get the impression that he is dangerous, u see him in a fight , and say I knew it , but the impression was before the thought and him being in a fight is nothing but a justification to the impression
3/19/22, 10:22 PM - AmineF0: Are we objective in our thinking
3/19/22, 10:23 PM - AmineF0: We say let's see it from an objective stand point but is seeing itself a proof that it is nothing but a perception
3/19/22, 10:23 PM - AmineF0: Anyway it's interesting
3/19/22, 10:25 PM - AmineF0: My point is I say that I'm damaging my health for a cause , I'm working I'm doing great things , is it true or is it what I want to believe?
3/19/22, 10:25 PM - AmineF0: Do I want to believe that it is possible to not damage my health and try to find excuses for it?
3/19/22, 10:26 PM - AmineF0: Or do I want not to believe it and find excuses?
3/19/22, 10:26 PM - AmineF0: ...
3/19/22, 10:26 PM - AmineF0: What am I talking abt
3/19/22, 10:27 PM - namoWonder: I'm not always the right person to talk , but according to my experiences with people and all , it's just what you want to believe , you are making dangerous excuses
3/19/22, 10:29 PM - namoWonder: The fucked up part is that I can't convince you or give arguments
3/19/22, 10:29 PM - namoWonder: I just believe in this by heart
3/19/22, 10:29 PM - namoWonder: And that's a problem imma be speaking by heart and you'll think logically
3/19/22, 10:31 PM - AmineF0: Fair enough
3/19/22, 10:31 PM - namoWonder: Call it even ?
3/19/22, 10:32 PM - AmineF0: Does it really matter hhh
3/19/22, 10:32 PM - namoWonder: Yes
3/19/22, 10:33 PM - AmineF0: But my point was i don't really know why I am doing the things am doing . I try to justify it, sometimes the excuse is right and sometimes I am denying something. But who is to say
3/19/22, 10:35 PM - AmineF0: Is the gifted rock with the curse of awareness, that is falling from a mountain aware that is being controlled by external forces or is it trying to justify that it is in control and wants to fall from the mountain
3/19/22, 10:35 PM - AmineF0: Sometimes I get too philosophical sorry hhh
3/19/22, 10:36 PM - AmineF0: But it is how I think
3/19/22, 10:36 PM - AmineF0: It's the source of my indecisiveness, do I really know? But it's not right sometimes
3/19/22, 10:36 PM - namoWonder: Do never apologize for that  u know
3/19/22, 10:37 PM - namoWonder: Do u see me apologizing for running away scaring hell out of my family?
3/19/22, 10:37 PM - namoWonder: We don't Apologize for thinking in such a wat or do such things
3/19/22, 10:37 PM - namoWonder: The think is
3/19/22, 10:38 PM - namoWonder: As much as those ideas are impressive , they have dangerous impact on you
3/19/22, 10:38 PM - namoWonder: Thing *
3/19/22, 10:40 PM - AmineF0: I know , that is why I create a façade of believes and we all do to some degree
3/19/22, 10:41 PM - AmineF0: When I see that something is not right in the façade I try to change it , but it comes down to proving it or me choosing to believe in it which is controlled with my emotions...
3/19/22, 10:42 PM - AmineF0: It's so complexe but we are trying our best , aren't we?
3/19/22, 10:42 PM - AmineF0: Do we want to believe that ? Hell yeah
3/19/22, 10:42 PM - AmineF0: So yeah I'm trying my best
3/19/22, 10:44 PM - namoWonder: Im sorry , i dont know why i cant completly absorb this
3/19/22, 10:45 PM - namoWonder: Beacsue if something that you're trying to change comes to prove or believe
3/19/22, 10:45 PM - namoWonder: You have to destroy it
3/19/22, 10:49 PM - AmineF0: Maybe because thinking has a foundation which is axioms , things we consider to be undoubtedly true
3/19/22, 10:49 PM - AmineF0: We like to think that thinking is objective but it comes down to a set of axioms
3/19/22, 10:50 PM - AmineF0: U know math itself which we consider natural comes down to axioms ...
3/19/22, 10:50 PM - AmineF0: Are u tired u had an exam and had maybe a long day
3/19/22, 10:54 PM - namoWonder: I'm sorry I zoned out
3/19/22, 10:55 PM - namoWonder: Idk if I'm tired I thought I still can go for a walk
3/19/22, 10:55 PM - namoWonder: I'm sorry I'm not focusing
3/19/22, 11:00 PM - AmineF0: Well don't push urself too hard
3/19/22, 11:01 PM - AmineF0: If u are tired just get some rest
3/20/22, 2:36 AM - namoWonder: And I did but um seems like the room is being attacked by ants so yeah panic
3/20/22, 2:40 AM - AmineF0: Ay that's an issue
3/20/22, 2:40 AM - AmineF0: Not to invade ur privacy , where are u staying, IBIS?
3/20/22, 2:41 AM - namoWonder: Yes and it was perfectly mine Idk why mom bought food here I don't know why she ignored that I have ants phobia
3/20/22, 2:42 AM - namoWonder: I don't remember why I thought bringing her was fine
3/20/22, 2:43 AM - namoWonder: You shouldn't stay up till now tho , that's not good
3/20/22, 2:44 AM - AmineF0: Well something didn't work and I can't work nor sleep, maybe I should just give up till the morning, euuhh
3/20/22, 2:44 AM - AmineF0: Another question, is that ibis next to the railway station?
3/20/22, 2:45 AM - namoWonder: Absolutely yes , no work after 13:30
3/20/22, 2:45 AM - namoWonder: Well 1 :30 *
3/20/22, 2:45 AM - namoWonder: I have no idea , I can't move or do anything , I'm scared
3/20/22, 2:46 AM - namoWonder: I think no ?
3/20/22, 2:46 AM - namoWonder: It's far
3/20/22, 2:49 AM - AmineF0: So that's not the place, anyway
3/20/22, 2:49 AM - AmineF0: Not experienced with phobias but make sure u re breathing
3/20/22, 2:49 AM - namoWonder: That  is the little one it's in the center and way too small and crowded
3/20/22, 2:50 AM - namoWonder: And there is railway station this one is way too far , I now can analyse
3/20/22, 2:54 AM - AmineF0: Well I just have a picture from my childhood , fes can be very beautiful in the rain , specially with the french like buildings
3/20/22, 2:57 AM - namoWonder: Idk rain makes it hard to go out
3/20/22, 2:58 AM - namoWonder: I don't think I want to be here anytime soon
3/20/22, 2:58 AM - AmineF0: Because ... ?
3/20/22, 2:58 AM - namoWonder: Ants
3/20/22, 3:06 AM - AmineF0: Of course
3/20/22, 3:07 AM - AmineF0: I was doing some reading and I found two conclusions, eliminate the problem and calm down using some breathing exercise
3/20/22, 3:08 AM - AmineF0: It must be overwhelming maybe doing that by urself now
3/20/22, 3:08 AM - AmineF0: I can't do much but read the internet but try to stay calm
3/20/22, 3:09 AM - AmineF0: U know what forget what I said
3/20/22, 3:09 AM - AmineF0: I have just read "don't give advice"
3/20/22, 3:09 AM - AmineF0: Well too late hhh
3/20/22, 3:11 AM - namoWonder: I'm calm , I'm good
3/20/22, 3:12 AM - namoWonder: Black one can't eat humans
3/20/22, 3:12 AM - namoWonder: But they know the red ones ?
3/20/22, 3:12 AM - namoWonder: They can touch us
3/20/22, 3:13 AM - AmineF0: Yeah that's my hero
3/20/22, 3:13 AM - AmineF0: Actually they hate each other , so no worries
3/20/22, 3:13 AM - namoWonder: How do you know
3/20/22, 3:15 AM - AmineF0: I was an ant before ,  but I was too late like all ants and died pathetically
3/20/22, 3:15 AM - AmineF0: I'm risking with these silly jokes
3/20/22, 3:15 AM - AmineF0: Weak*
3/20/22, 3:15 AM - namoWonder: Omg they can swim
3/20/22, 3:15 AM - namoWonder: It's waterproof
3/20/22, 3:17 AM - namoWonder: Well did you had political power as an ant ? Did you trust your leader when he sais we hate them ? They work together
3/20/22, 3:18 AM - AmineF0: Nah we had a stupid gov , all they thought about is making the people work , they were stupid anyway
3/20/22, 3:19 AM - AmineF0: I can't find anything on the internet about making stupid jokes...
3/20/22, 3:19 AM - namoWonder: Stupid isn't unable to murder
3/20/22, 3:29 AM - AmineF0: Gotta get my revenge, don't worry
3/20/22, 3:30 AM - AmineF0: I swear to God if something bad happened to u from an ant , i will become known as the ant serial killer and torture every ant comes to my sight
3/20/22, 3:31 AM - namoWonder: But they are millions ?
3/20/22, 3:31 AM - namoWonder: They add up every day
3/20/22, 3:31 AM - AmineF0: Then I will make robots specialized at burning them
3/20/22, 3:31 AM - AmineF0: It's not that hard
3/20/22, 3:32 AM - AmineF0: And making a factory that makes the robots, i can come up with the resources with time
3/20/22, 3:32 AM - namoWonder: Robots can kill ants ?
3/20/22, 3:32 AM - AmineF0: They can learn
3/20/22, 3:32 AM - AmineF0: Image recognition, detect the position of the ant , BUUUURRRRRNNNN
3/20/22, 3:33 AM - namoWonder: Do they die by fire ?
3/20/22, 3:34 AM - namoWonder: They are like cockroaches
3/20/22, 3:34 AM - namoWonder: They don't die
3/20/22, 3:35 AM - AmineF0: Of course , and they suffer while dying , it's a slow painful process
3/20/22, 3:35 AM - AmineF0: We can use vinegar too
3/20/22, 3:35 AM - namoWonder: They suffer when we use venom
3/20/22, 3:35 AM - namoWonder: It's doesn't work anymore
3/20/22, 3:36 AM - AmineF0: We will use a looot
3/20/22, 3:36 AM - AmineF0: Robots making tear gaz to stop an ant protest hhh
3/20/22, 3:37 AM - namoWonder: Imagine an ants protest?
3/20/22, 3:37 AM - AmineF0: Good for us nuke the shit out of it
3/20/22, 3:37 AM - namoWonder: Ants ans putin are the same the both can end the world
3/20/22, 3:37 AM - namoWonder: And
3/20/22, 3:37 AM - namoWonder: There is this story mom said soulayman and all and he didn't kill an ant and stopped an army for it
3/20/22, 3:38 AM - namoWonder: And she fell asleep thinking that will help me know how sacred ants are
3/20/22, 3:38 AM - namoWonder: What
3/20/22, 3:39 AM - namoWonder: Sacred to kill a snake but not an ant ? Snakes are better at least he will just bite me or eat me without me being aware , poisoned better than eaten alive don't we agree here
3/20/22, 3:40 AM - AmineF0: Well I don't think that kitchen ants are capable of any harm but that is just my opinion
3/20/22, 3:40 AM - AmineF0: Who am I say really
3/20/22, 3:42 AM - AmineF0: But they are stupid anyway and are incapable of malicious acts so
3/20/22, 3:42 AM - AmineF0: I used to get rid of them using sugar, put sugar in trap , they are attracted to the sugar and voila , u will never see the light again
3/20/22, 3:43 AM - AmineF0: Am I to say*
3/20/22, 3:43 AM - namoWonder: A friend of mine used that sugar trap
3/20/22, 3:43 AM - namoWonder: And used to eat them
3/20/22, 3:44 AM - AmineF0: Nah nah that's too far, and she seems experienced with a ants, well I have found another partner in the mass genocide plan
3/20/22, 3:45 AM - AmineF0: Why did I assume she is a she?
3/20/22, 3:45 AM - AmineF0: Human mind , anywa
3/20/22, 3:45 AM - namoWonder: Exactly
3/20/22, 3:45 AM - namoWonder: Why
3/20/22, 3:45 AM - namoWonder: Because it's a she
3/20/22, 3:46 AM - AmineF0: Yeah she is an it and it is a she ans she is a she and it is an it
3/20/22, 3:46 AM - AmineF0: And an it can be a she but a she can't be a she
3/20/22, 3:46 AM - AmineF0: Feels like surat Al kafiron
3/20/22, 3:46 AM - namoWonder: Hhhhhhhhhhhh
3/20/22, 3:47 AM - namoWonder: I had many ants panic situation
3/20/22, 3:47 AM - namoWonder: But never laughed in one till now
3/20/22, 3:47 AM - namoWonder: I'm sorry you have to deal me , aren't you ready to sleep
3/20/22, 3:48 AM - AmineF0: Nah nah, I mean u re worth, u know that
3/20/22, 3:50 AM - namoWonder: But it's 4 am it will be 6 then I can leave
3/20/22, 3:50 AM - namoWonder: And you need rest
3/20/22, 3:51 AM - AmineF0: U planning to stay awake? Well it's understandable
3/20/22, 3:51 AM - AmineF0: Well I don't deny the fact that I need to rest , I'm scared to death from the upcoming weeks
3/20/22, 3:52 AM - namoWonder: Exams ?
3/20/22, 3:52 AM - AmineF0: But u know if 2 hours can make u feel much better I mean I'm willing to take it
3/20/22, 3:53 AM - namoWonder: I'm trying to reach my bag for the calming pills but I'm scared I feel so childish here and I'm trying not to hate my mom
3/20/22, 3:53 AM - namoWonder: What's coming next weeks
3/20/22, 3:54 AM - namoWonder: If you need rest then take some please , thank you but i refuse to keep you up till 6
3/20/22, 3:55 AM - namoWonder: I may try and close my eyes a bit I suppose
3/20/22, 3:58 AM - AmineF0: Too much work and things I'm involved in and I'm already burnt out , i don't know if I have the energy to endure what's coming, it's a real pressure , and i can't sleep well either... And i don't think the 2 hours sleep will make it much better
3/20/22, 3:59 AM - AmineF0: So I'm willing to give it to you
3/20/22, 4:03 AM - namoWonder: 2 hours is always Better than  sleepless nights , for sleep try magnesium and most importantly please eat well , you may not have mental energy but you gotta have the physical one , eat well
3/20/22, 4:04 AM - namoWonder: I know you're burnt out but as an adult you have to heal slowly but also manage to get things done , after that you will get some time to do less and heal more
3/20/22, 4:05 AM - AmineF0: The next weeks are definitely not the time to heal, just getting it all out
3/20/22, 4:05 AM - AmineF0: I'm already worried about the shortage of food in Ramadan
3/20/22, 4:06 AM - AmineF0: I'm not fasting but that's stressful by itself
3/20/22, 4:06 AM - namoWonder: It's a do more and heal less weeks
3/20/22, 4:06 AM - namoWonder: Hhhhhh true , Ramadan can be worrying
3/20/22, 4:08 AM - namoWonder: If you feel a huge shortage of sleep take a day off in the next weeks and sleep otherwise you'll get nothing done or do half stuff
3/20/22, 4:09 AM - namoWonder: Or worst, your body will choose that day
3/20/22, 4:09 AM - AmineF0: Yeah I know.
3/20/22, 4:10 AM - AmineF0: And it's an interesting phenomenon too how taking a rest sometimes becomes stressful too
3/20/22, 4:10 AM - AmineF0: U think that u re taking a rest but somethings need to be done and it's fire on the house
3/20/22, 4:11 AM - namoWonder: That we can learn to manage
3/20/22, 4:11 AM - namoWonder: You are going to sleep now
3/20/22, 4:11 AM - namoWonder: Rest
3/20/22, 4:12 AM - namoWonder: Sleep and food aren't to be fucked with
3/20/22, 4:13 AM - AmineF0: How are u doing tho?
3/20/22, 4:14 AM - namoWonder: I'm not crying and breathing well , that's enough for me
3/20/22, 4:15 AM - namoWonder: Scared but stable so i can handle till the sun is here
3/20/22, 4:15 AM - namoWonder: Now rest please?
3/20/22, 4:16 AM - AmineF0: Yeah it's unfortunate that i will leave u deal with it by urself but u re strong and can deal with it
3/20/22, 4:17 AM - AmineF0: If I stay more up the depressed me will control hhh
3/20/22, 4:17 AM - namoWonder: Hhhhhhhh get your rest dear and be easy on you

4/15/22, 2:03 PM - AmineF0: Oh yeah
4/15/22, 2:03 PM - AmineF0: I'm already having PTSD
4/15/22, 2:07 PM - namoWonder: PTSD ? Because of a station ?
4/15/22, 2:07 PM - AmineF0: Heavy Luggage, taxis...
4/15/22, 2:09 PM - namoWonder: That has its own charm tho , cheer up
4/15/22, 2:09 PM - namoWonder: How are you doing with ramadan and all ?
4/15/22, 2:53 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
4/15/22, 2:55 PM - AmineF0: Good , not fasting but not eating either hhh and that comes with its own stress
4/15/22, 2:55 PM - AmineF0: Other than that we are trying to go through everyday one day at a time
4/15/22, 2:55 PM - AmineF0: How about you?
4/15/22, 3:09 PM - namoWonder: If you're not eating then better fasting , it's nice a bit , like convalescence
4/15/22, 3:10 PM - namoWonder: Good to know , things go on anyways and how is running for presidency?
4/15/22, 3:10 PM - namoWonder: I'm good , u know me just being everywhere I'm in fes again
4/15/22, 3:19 PM - AmineF0: And finally made it home
4/15/22, 3:19 PM - AmineF0: We are making a "big" competition next week
4/15/22, 3:20 PM - AmineF0: And we have been doing some ads , going around asking people to solve a problem for 20dh
4/15/22, 3:20 PM - AmineF0: My social battery is below 0
4/15/22, 3:20 PM - AmineF0: Just traveling or having to do something
4/15/22, 4:41 PM - namoWonder: Now that's cool hhhhhhh people can do anything for money
4/15/22, 4:41 PM - namoWonder: And how is preparation?
4/15/22, 4:42 PM - namoWonder: Because of preparation or you just can't stand people anymore
4/15/22, 4:44 PM - namoWonder: I actually missed the exam , I got 57 / 60 so gotta pay and try again and this comes along with my need to come to fez again so "good match" and here I am lost again here
4/15/22, 4:49 PM - AmineF0: I don't know little bit of everything and talking to stranger is a big one
4/15/22, 4:50 PM - AmineF0: Trying not to overdo it and fight my urge to micromanage and instead split tasks and focus on mine
4/15/22, 4:51 PM - AmineF0: Well good luck, that was close
4/15/22, 4:51 PM - AmineF0: Should u get a perfect score to pass?
4/15/22, 4:52 PM - namoWonder: Do y'all really need micromanaging or it's just you ?
4/15/22, 4:53 PM - namoWonder: What's with strangers hhhhh they usually have the best advices , unless we aint talking about same strangers kind of people
4/15/22, 4:54 PM - namoWonder: Nah all I needed is 60 or 61 to pass but I'm not the luckiest am I
4/15/22, 4:57 PM - AmineF0: I don't really know how other people think but my mind is different,while thinking about the event i imagine it to the details and try to implement my vision, but I have learned not to overdo it and ...
4/15/22, 4:59 PM - AmineF0: What I mean by a stranger is someone that doesn't know much about you , neither do u know about him , thus your interaction requires more energy
4/15/22, 5:00 PM - AmineF0: It's just me probably , i have noticed that I need knowledge to act, because it gives me power and decisiveness, which can be toxic when I don't have it
4/15/22, 5:02 PM - AmineF0: Well that happens, and u won an adventure in fez so enjoy it...
4/15/22, 5:03 PM - namoWonder: That because you always see them as a danger i suppose and you need power to protect yourself since you don't know much
4/15/22, 5:04 PM - namoWonder: But here is the thing, I don't need to know you a lot I need to know enough and if it's enough then it's okay , I can have some faith about that stranger and trust them a bit to have a chit-chat maybe share private infos
4/15/22, 5:05 PM - namoWonder: Also you dont need to feel bad about how you DO it, it's your way its fine if its over and if details matter then they just do the thing is you just need a way to make others see how important that detail is
4/15/22, 5:06 PM - namoWonder: I finished it , nothing much to see  anymore
4/15/22, 5:08 PM - AmineF0: No way I'm denying that , a social interaction is a battle for me , and i have learn to act it well lately but it's still unnatural and is tiring... I guess it will need more time ...
4/15/22, 5:09 PM - AmineF0: U finished the adventure or the test?
4/15/22, 5:11 PM - namoWonder: Not time , I don't think so I can imagine how hard it can be but I believe if you remove the danger idea you'll be fine and you remove that by thinking what's the worst that can happen and what will i do if it happens then u go for it
4/15/22, 5:11 PM - namoWonder: The fez
4/15/22, 5:12 PM - AmineF0: Well I tried thinking abt that now and i can guarantee that it make some weird shit surface
4/15/22, 5:12 PM - AmineF0: I guess that's something I need to meditate on more and try to heal
4/15/22, 5:13 PM - AmineF0: How is ur Ramadan?
4/15/22, 5:20 PM - namoWonder: Or maybe you don't need to , not all environments are okay with healing
4/15/22, 5:20 PM - namoWonder: Good just surprised how everyone is worrying about food ?
4/15/22, 5:21 PM - namoWonder: Like i went to buy smoked turkey and the lady said no I'm pregnant let me go first , even tho there is a huge ball of turkey
4/15/22, 5:34 PM - AmineF0: Hhh humans
4/15/22, 5:36 PM - AmineF0: Anyway I'm dead tired , gonna sleep
4/15/22, 5:37 PM - namoWonder: Yes sure , good to know you're fine
4/15/22, 5:37 PM - namoWonder: Take care
4/15/22, 5:38 PM - AmineF0: Wish u good luck with the test
4/15/22, 5:38 PM - AmineF0: And take care too
4/15/22, 5:39 PM - AmineF0: We can talk later if u want to talk abt something
4/15/22, 5:51 PM - namoWonder: Whenever you feel like talking buddy

4/15/22, 10:54 PM - AmineF0: The worst kind of motivational speech u can get
4/15/22, 10:54 PM - AmineF0: warning: It's loud
4/15/22, 10:55 PM - namoWonder: how can you sleep with no food tho ?

4/15/22, 11:09 PM - namoWonder: did you eat tho ??
4/15/22, 11:09 PM - AmineF0: Yeah I have cooked chicken in a new way
4/15/22, 11:09 PM - AmineF0: And it was amazing
4/15/22, 11:12 PM - namoWonder: now look at youuuuu , this is the best thing i heard today
4/15/22, 11:13 PM - AmineF0: Well the thing is I used to cook turkey with onion grilled in oil
4/15/22, 11:13 PM - AmineF0: It used to be dry
4/15/22, 11:13 PM - AmineF0: But when I did turkey with vegetables, it becomes grilled from the outside by soft from the inside
4/15/22, 11:14 PM - AmineF0: And i was mhm , i wanna eat chicken like bread how can I do that...
4/15/22, 11:15 PM - AmineF0: I bought chicken breast with shawarma sauce , and slice it to small pieces and slightly grilled onion with tomatoes
4/15/22, 11:15 PM - AmineF0: But added water and chicken
4/15/22, 11:15 PM - AmineF0: And some cinnamon
4/15/22, 11:15 PM - AmineF0: And i have got a caramelized chicken which is sweet and salty , and very soft
4/15/22, 11:16 PM - AmineF0: It was a new whole experience
4/15/22, 11:16 PM - AmineF0: I can get creative sometimes with cooking
4/15/22, 11:16 PM - AmineF0: If engineering doesn't work out i may open a restaurant
4/15/22, 11:19 PM - AmineF0: Anyway go sleep or study or something
4/15/22, 11:20 PM - namoWonder: hhhhhhhh no give me a moment i need to finish a call , brb

4/15/22, 11:22 PM - AmineF0: Yeah I can see that
4/15/22, 11:23 PM - AmineF0: Is that a problem or he is just good friend or what exactly...?
4/15/22, 11:23 PM - namoWonder: Just being annoying ?
4/15/22, 11:24 PM - namoWonder: Me being the youngest everywhere I work or study and friendly way too much gets me in trouble and yeah
4/15/22, 11:25 PM - namoWonder: It's a weird thing, for exemple I wanted to see the school of 3atarin
4/15/22, 11:25 PM - namoWonder: I'm supposed to pay 20 dh but a lil smile and chit-chat he made me pay 3 dh
4/15/22, 11:26 PM - namoWonder: U win but you lose being comfy and it's always men
4/15/22, 11:26 PM - namoWonder: But back to the bohemian experience hhhhhhhh
4/15/22, 11:28 PM - namoWonder: I used to thing its only a ramadan thing but you proved me wrong, how come you don't grill chicken with vegetables in the first place
4/15/22, 11:29 PM - namoWonder: Name it  ratatouille please
4/15/22, 11:30 PM - AmineF0: Hhh sure thing
4/15/22, 11:31 PM - AmineF0: Well I don't cook very often but when I do I have some desire for a taste that i look for and that's what guide me in cooking , I'm not a conventional cook , well I don't know how to cook the traditional dishes
4/15/22, 11:32 PM - AmineF0: Lmar9a and so forth
4/15/22, 11:32 PM - AmineF0: I just mess around using my dear "ma9la" and make something edible
4/15/22, 11:32 PM - AmineF0: And most of the time it is something tasty
4/15/22, 11:33 PM - namoWonder: Anything with a ma9la and olive oil is tasty tho
4/15/22, 11:34 PM - AmineF0: "Bellisimo" - me cooking eggs and imagining my self some Italian chef
4/15/22, 11:35 PM - namoWonder: Those are really out of cooking world , but tajins are really good if they well traditionally cooked
4/15/22, 11:36 PM - namoWonder: You got the spirit hhhhhh
4/15/22, 11:36 PM - AmineF0: If u sleep now u will get less than 9h of sleep
4/15/22, 11:37 PM - AmineF0: Is that enough?
4/15/22, 11:37 PM - namoWonder: i sleep till 2 and wake up at 7 , its my program
4/15/22, 11:38 PM - AmineF0: That's not fair hhhh
4/15/22, 11:39 PM - AmineF0: I envy you the people who can get enough sleep in 5h
4/15/22, 11:39 PM - namoWonder: not fair ? hhhhhhh
4/15/22, 11:39 PM - namoWonder: its not enough hhhhh i chose it
4/15/22, 11:40 PM - namoWonder: and i programmed me to deal with it and make it enough
4/15/22, 11:41 PM - AmineF0: That takes dedication
4/15/22, 11:41 PM - AmineF0: Good for u
4/15/22, 11:41 PM - namoWonder: you are a damn engineer , you can do it better than me
4/15/22, 11:41 PM - AmineF0: Yeah I'm just messing around
4/15/22, 11:42 PM - AmineF0: Should u study or something?
4/15/22, 11:42 PM - namoWonder: supposed to

4/15/22, 11:43 PM - namoWonder: nah you go if you got things to do hhhhhh
4/15/22, 11:44 PM - AmineF0: I'm free
4/15/22, 11:44 PM - AmineF0: It's the weekend, i have learned to use a slower pace in the weekends for recovery
4/15/22, 11:46 PM - namoWonder: clever
4/15/22, 11:47 PM - AmineF0: The importance of self care , something our discussions made me learn
4/15/22, 11:47 PM - AmineF0: It really helps a lot
4/15/22, 11:47 PM - namoWonder: i was hesitating , i wanted to ask if its going well
4/15/22, 11:48 PM - namoWonder: Discipline or not , the whole self-care thing
4/15/22, 11:48 PM - AmineF0: It's easier for me nowadays and it's rewarding enough
4/15/22, 11:49 PM - AmineF0: But I got my issues, it's so weird how at my lowest point if my life i can be the best version of myself
4/15/22, 11:50 PM - AmineF0: I'm the most depressed and suicidal i have ever been and yet I'm there winning competitions and assisting to all my classes and managing teams...
4/15/22, 11:50 PM - AmineF0: Life is so weird
4/15/22, 11:51 PM - namoWonder: No it makes sense
4/15/22, 11:51 PM - namoWonder: You see it ? Or?
4/15/22, 11:52 PM - namoWonder: Hhhhhh that was fast because
4/15/22, 11:52 PM - AmineF0: Yeah a little bit , when u got nothing to lose u just do it with ease...
4/15/22, 11:52 PM - AmineF0: No stress no worries , everything becomes easy
4/15/22, 11:53 PM - AmineF0: Some weird tranquility and peace of mind
4/15/22, 11:53 PM - namoWonder: Maybe and maybe because your self versions aren't connected to your life points
4/15/22, 11:54 PM - namoWonder: May be the lowest but still succeeding in life and maybe the highest but still ready to commit suicide any moment
4/15/22, 11:55 PM - namoWonder: When doing things seem easy , that means we are already losing or we about to lose
4/15/22, 11:56 PM - namoWonder: Not that we have nothing to lose
4/15/22, 11:56 PM - namoWonder: But that's not absolute ofc , it's just how to see it
4/15/22, 11:56 PM - namoWonder: I*
4/15/22, 11:57 PM - AmineF0: Yeah that's an interesting wording of things
4/15/22, 11:58 PM - AmineF0: But don't worry , i am busy so most of the time so I'm distracted
4/15/22, 11:59 PM - AmineF0: It's just a weird road my mind took at some point
4/16/22, 12:00 AM - namoWonder: Instead of being distracted try learning
4/16/22, 12:00 AM - namoWonder: Not studying but learning
4/16/22, 12:01 AM - namoWonder: Idk why I give advice but I don't like when we get to suicide
4/16/22, 12:02 AM - namoWonder: I know the tips and all , I believe it will work if that person takes them seriously , I'm sorry it comes with unconsciousness
4/16/22, 12:02 AM - AmineF0: What do u mean unconsciousness
4/16/22, 12:05 AM - namoWonder: It's unconsciousness, you hear a world and you stop , your next moves aren't logical nor understood, what comes next comes automatically
4/16/22, 12:06 AM - AmineF0: Ah yeah that unconsciousness
4/16/22, 12:07 AM - AmineF0: Well here is the weirdest plan , I'm not planning it or wanting it or anything, it's not out of anger or fear or sadness or anything
4/16/22, 12:07 AM - AmineF0: It's just a state of nothingness a void in my mind , and in the not feeling anything , everything is far a way by a thought including the act of suicide
4/16/22, 12:08 AM - AmineF0: So that's the busyness i was talking about , being a part in things
4/16/22, 12:09 AM - AmineF0: Aboiding the empty mind
4/16/22, 12:09 AM - AmineF0: Weirdest thing*
4/16/22, 12:11 AM - namoWonder: If you say so
4/16/22, 12:11 AM - namoWonder: Are you sure about those words ?
4/16/22, 12:12 AM - AmineF0: You know when I think about it and what does it really mean and why will I do that, i mean the mechanism behind that chain of thoughts
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - AmineF0: I'm digging too deep
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - AmineF0: Can we change the topic
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - namoWonder: Absolutely
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - AmineF0: I feel like I'm starting to think in toxic way
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - namoWonder: And you better not overthink it
4/16/22, 12:13 AM - AmineF0: Yeah that's the thing
4/16/22, 12:14 AM - AmineF0: Listen you , you have things to do right
4/16/22, 12:14 AM - AmineF0: I'm not really feeling guilty that I'm dragging this conversation but if u have things to do , if u believe so of course, then go for it
4/16/22, 12:15 AM - namoWonder: I think imma go for a walk and then back to sleep and that's it now
4/16/22, 12:16 AM - namoWonder: And you sir , you take care very well
4/16/22, 12:16 AM - AmineF0: Absolutely
4/16/22, 12:17 AM - AmineF0: I have a question to ask later when u re free
4/16/22, 12:17 AM - AmineF0: And take care and good luck with exam tomorrow
4/16/22, 12:17 AM - AmineF0: U CAN DO IT
4/16/22, 12:17 AM - AmineF0: Don't let your dreams be dreams
4/16/22, 12:17 AM - namoWonder: Hearing it from you makes it more acceptable hhhhh
4/16/22, 12:18 AM - namoWonder: I'm curious but no harm in waiting , don't forget ur question
4/16/22, 12:18 AM - namoWonder: See ya and thank very much for all
4/16/22, 12:18 AM - namoWonder: Thank you *
4/16/22, 12:18 AM - AmineF0: Really? Don't feel like i have done anything

4/16/22, 1:31 PM - namoWonder: How is your day and resting going
4/16/22, 1:35 PM - AmineF0: Yeah hotter days
4/16/22, 1:35 PM - AmineF0: Nothing out of the usual
4/16/22, 1:36 PM - namoWonder: Isn't it finals time ?
4/16/22, 1:38 PM - AmineF0: No we had midterm test last week
4/16/22, 1:38 PM - AmineF0: They changed the style again , we know have of hellish week when we do everything
4/16/22, 1:38 PM - AmineF0: Now*
4/16/22, 1:39 PM - AmineF0: So free weekends
4/16/22, 1:40 PM - namoWonder: Well that's better isn't it
4/16/22, 1:40 PM - AmineF0: Yeah probably
4/16/22, 1:41 PM - namoWonder: There is no probably hhhh , you got 2 days of free time and if you won't have chores then you'll get to do fun things
4/16/22, 1:42 PM - AmineF0: Yeah well I'm trying to cook on the weekends so yeah it's true
4/16/22, 1:43 PM - AmineF0: Coming back to casa or still wanna discover fez more
4/16/22, 1:44 PM - namoWonder: Discover ? I finished it and I'm done with their sun , I'm on my way to casa
4/16/22, 1:44 PM - namoWonder: Try adding pasta or rice , create something and let me know how it goes
4/16/22, 1:44 PM - AmineF0: Well that's something, to finish a city in "two days"
4/16/22, 1:45 PM - AmineF0: Yeah rice is my favorite and pasta too , better than bread in my eyes
4/16/22, 1:45 PM - AmineF0: Cooking is great when there is no pressure
4/16/22, 1:45 PM - AmineF0: Everything is like that probably
4/16/22, 1:46 PM - namoWonder: The only people who say that are those who have a great long experience with the kitchen , good that you noticed earlier
4/16/22, 1:47 PM - namoWonder: No , pressure breaks laziness , not everything can be done with being chill
4/16/22, 1:48 PM - namoWonder: Get to make friendship with an old taxi man and he will give up his day to show u everything hhhhhhh
4/16/22, 1:49 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
4/16/22, 1:49 PM - AmineF0: U know that was the topic of my question, u have talked yesterday about you special "pass" with men
4/16/22, 1:50 PM - AmineF0: And to my mind that something that triggers big questions
4/16/22, 1:51 PM - AmineF0: I mean very aware of the men side of things and can easily imagine the chain of thoughts and feelings they may have , but how does it feel to be in the receiving end?
4/16/22, 1:51 PM - AmineF0: I mean I'm very aware*
4/16/22, 1:52 PM - namoWonder: It's simply disgusting
4/16/22, 1:57 PM - namoWonder: There is an advice that I follow " get ur business done but don't lose more that you should " , I know their ideas and their future moves so what I do is get my thing done like I got cheap tour around the school and i get to have snacks in hotels and easier tasks sometimes at work and bla bla but I also know they wait for the weak second but I don't lose anything because he will not achieve that second
4/16/22, 1:59 PM - namoWonder: It's just how things are , you can't say no directly because once a woman in a situation of sexual harassment its too late but what she cam do is to get the business done and makes it slow for him to get what he wants so as she doesn't lose herself mentally and physically
4/16/22, 2:01 PM - namoWonder: If no is useful I wouldn't be traumatized because of that man but I know now that men are just men they are controlled basically by their sexual needs almost all the time the only way to survive and not give up is to play the game but in my rules
4/16/22, 2:05 PM - namoWonder: It's okay to play dirty as long as he is losing not me  , i may answer u late but u don't know if ur call is registered or if it's the last , u make me pay less but u know the police is right next  door if u make move
4/16/22, 2:07 PM - namoWonder: U see men don't see the whole situation once they decide to play the game , they forget that they can't always win because it's the beginning and you can't achieve what u want meanwhile if SHE let  It go and went chill , she is lost
4/16/22, 2:10 PM - namoWonder: What's disgusting is that it's just surviving there are no ways
4/16/22, 2:14 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , well I feel for that u have to go through all this shit everyday , but I'm more reassured seeing that u have developed a way to make it ur way
4/16/22, 2:15 PM - AmineF0: I have noticed and probably knew all along that it's not only that the men behavior change while dealing with each sex , but also the reaction to the same behavior change
4/16/22, 2:17 PM - AmineF0: I can say that I'm not very comfortable and tend to overthink my interaction with men mainly because of lack of knowledge, i know men, and i know what to talk about and what's the redline (is there a redline) and we can get loud and agressive and energetic and violent while having fun , but I have noticed that it's more important while dealing with women to try to present urself not as a threat ...
4/16/22, 2:18 PM - AmineF0: And it just goes back to how my power is from my knowledge, and my ignorance about what "women mind" lead me to be more indecisive...
4/16/22, 2:19 PM - AmineF0: In the same time I'm aware that certain behavior we emit as man in our interactions with women are straight up red flags ... And I'm trying to understand the other side ...
4/16/22, 2:20 PM - AmineF0: Overthink my interaction with women*
4/16/22, 2:21 PM - AmineF0: Do you get my point ? My text is not that organized
4/16/22, 2:22 PM - namoWonder: I always do its fine hhhhh
4/16/22, 2:22 PM - namoWonder: I need to know what u mean by the other side ?
4/16/22, 2:27 PM - namoWonder: When it comes to women mind it honestly either dealing with a woman or a girl , for example believe it or not a woman appreciate your respect as long as you know when to come closer , a girl will not appreciate that
4/16/22, 2:29 PM - namoWonder: One thing I'm absolutely sure to say and that I noticed in men I do respect and glad to have in my life is that kindness mixed with respect is a basic way to win a female either a woman or a girl
4/16/22, 2:31 PM - namoWonder: You're kind enough to make her comfy and able to trust that you will nit Hurt her ( without showing that you obviously have a desire behind it) but you do show respect that will make her in turn try to be worth that respect so you yourself dont lose your self respect with her and by that i mean crossing each others redlines
4/16/22, 2:31 PM - namoWonder: Not*
4/16/22, 2:32 PM - AmineF0: Yeah u re right
4/16/22, 2:33 PM - AmineF0: It's a very complex topic , for example u can't deny a girl from going to the toilet ( that is just an example , is it red flag to talk about, i don't know)
4/16/22, 2:33 PM - AmineF0: ...
4/16/22, 2:33 PM - AmineF0: There is special needs and things I'm not aware of as a man , and that unanswered question is a handicap
4/16/22, 2:36 PM - AmineF0: I have a strategy i am trying to do more , u give a random response and see the reaction, if it is positive u enforce the behavior else u change, without the need to understand, u can monitor ur behavior...
4/16/22, 2:36 PM - AmineF0: Do u see what I mean , in concrete terms , try to pay more attention to the other person and his "micro" reaction
4/16/22, 2:37 PM - AmineF0: I by nature use my ears more than my eyes in social interactions
4/16/22, 2:37 PM - AmineF0: ...
4/16/22, 2:38 PM - AmineF0: So I should pay more attention by observing expressions and reactions more , not just what was said ...
4/16/22, 2:38 PM - AmineF0: I'm doing it again, engineering my behavior
4/16/22, 2:40 PM - namoWonder: No actually it's correct , it's like testing which is fine and you have the right to do so the issue is once you see it positive you gotta stop overthinking it you just let your kindness and respect speak for you
4/16/22, 2:41 PM - namoWonder: Not necessary because a woman likes it more if you remember what she said , you build first a base in which you can have physical interactions
4/16/22, 2:42 PM - namoWonder: About the special needs , those are to learn and observe , it's science
4/16/22, 2:44 PM - namoWonder: Going to the bathroom is a need , you cant deny her from going you don't know if she is on period maybe she is pregnant maybe and maybe .... you can not stand againt her as a female with needs different than yours and that's a science people don't want to know
4/16/22, 2:45 PM - namoWonder: A much more catastrophic topic is sexual orgasms , the " men come first and let women there with no orgasm " which a man can solve by just learning how her body works and how they both can achieve their thing , it's just science you see
4/16/22, 2:47 PM - namoWonder: She is on period with deadly cramps she obviously doesn't need you to be another cramp , you don't need a lot to know but to take care and be kind
4/16/22, 2:48 PM - AmineF0: That came out of nowhere hhh
4/16/22, 2:49 PM - AmineF0: Yeah google is my guide sometimes I go on some tangents and read for hours but it's unfortunate that such topics are taboo, is it unfortunate? ...
4/16/22, 2:49 PM - AmineF0: Well I guess that answers most of my questions tnx
4/16/22, 2:51 PM - namoWonder: Cherishing and kindness are really one of the best things humans offer you know
4/16/22, 2:53 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , well we are learning to be better humans ...
4/16/22, 2:53 PM - AmineF0: Anything on ur mind?
4/16/22, 2:56 PM - namoWonder: Not really , me not reading books lately makes me feel way too weak to discuss somehow
4/16/22, 2:56 PM - namoWonder: How do you see divorce tho ?
4/16/22, 2:58 PM - namoWonder: How would you feel if your parents decided to divorce? I'm sorry  You don't have to answer if it crosses a private statement , I just need to be clear
4/16/22, 2:59 PM - AmineF0: " أبغض الحلال"
4/16/22, 3:00 PM - AmineF0: I am too mature and emotionally stable not to be affected much by it, but discussion i will be pushing is what comes next, specially with the children
4/16/22, 3:00 PM - AmineF0: I don't mean the simple question who will take them ? But how can provide a good environment for them to grow
4/16/22, 3:02 PM - AmineF0: And make sure that also each partner isn't doomed after it , they spent too much time together , some kindness and care must be kept...
4/16/22, 3:02 PM - AmineF0: I guess that's how I see it
4/16/22, 3:02 PM - AmineF0: How about you?
4/16/22, 3:07 PM - namoWonder: I like the idea of divorce I see it as the " forbidden freedom " that partners keep dreaming about , the children choose one of the parent because they know that this ONE will give them both mental and financial care , or they will at least chose the one with the mental caring
4/16/22, 3:07 PM - namoWonder: That is correct but not all divorced people are that mature
4/16/22, 3:09 PM - namoWonder: Financial care is important for an environment so as they grow but I believe if they are happy mentally they will not care about Financial problems, they know that parent is enough and will do all what it takes for them
4/16/22, 3:13 PM - AmineF0: Did I get it right
4/16/22, 3:13 PM - AmineF0: If u don't like one parent that much. Then divorce is beneficial because u will get only what u like?
4/16/22, 3:14 PM - namoWonder: It's not about who you like the most , it's about who will do the best for you in both mental and financial sides to grow
4/16/22, 3:16 PM - namoWonder: They may follow the one with financial power but later they notice that's not what they actually need
4/16/22, 3:16 PM - namoWonder: They don't accept divorce sometimes they like having the " family: 2 parents and kids " but later they know it's okay with divorce
4/16/22, 3:18 PM - AmineF0: Yeah the conventional widom
4/16/22, 3:19 PM - AmineF0: And i agree with you in the idea, but it may vary from case to case
4/16/22, 3:21 PM - namoWonder: Absolutely that's not a rule but they are basic things kids with divorced parents share of course
4/16/22, 3:24 PM - AmineF0: How is the new work?
4/16/22, 3:25 PM - namoWonder: It's fine but the 9-5 jobs are killing people who don't know how to live
4/16/22, 3:26 PM - namoWonder: The art of loving
4/16/22, 3:26 PM - namoWonder: Yes finally
4/16/22, 3:26 PM - namoWonder: I've been trying to remember that book since yesterday and it comes now since I wrote " how to live"
4/16/22, 3:31 PM - AmineF0: Is it worth the read?
4/16/22, 3:31 PM - AmineF0: I have read conflicting reviews
4/16/22, 3:33 PM - namoWonder: My german teacher used to talk a lot about it and he is a man with good books ideas so I will read it
4/16/22, 3:34 PM - namoWonder: Aren't you sick of people seeing love as magic ?
4/16/22, 3:34 PM - namoWonder: At least this one sees it as a skill
4/16/22, 3:34 PM - namoWonder: Yes love impact is magic but not love itself
4/16/22, 3:35 PM - AmineF0: It may be magic , but if it's only magic it wouldn't last for long
4/16/22, 3:35 PM - AmineF0: That's how I see it
4/16/22, 3:37 PM - namoWonder: Love really make people alive and beautiful but it's really challenging to make it last and warm
4/16/22, 3:38 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , i don't really if the probability of finding that "perfect" match is that high
4/16/22, 3:39 PM - namoWonder: A perfect match ?
4/16/22, 3:40 PM - AmineF0: Someone compatible and willing to put that much effort
4/16/22, 3:42 PM - namoWonder: Idk I've many friends who did found their match and they are happy , with kids or not they are enough for each other
4/16/22, 3:43 PM - namoWonder: But they don't find each other good and compatible since they day one ofc , all I see is that they believed its worth it and they made it workout
4/16/22, 3:44 PM - AmineF0: Yeah that must be the thing , it's an investment
4/16/22, 3:44 PM - AmineF0: Takes time and effort to mature
4/16/22, 3:45 PM - namoWonder: As long as you have no kids there is always time to do things hhhhhh
4/16/22, 3:46 PM - namoWonder: You need to enjoy your day my friend , it's 4 pm
4/16/22, 3:47 PM - AmineF0: And the quit option is way easier
4/16/22, 3:48 PM - AmineF0: Ate breakfast , watching a football game, avoiding too much work...

4/16/22, 3:56 PM - AmineF0: Not yet

4/16/22, 3:58 PM - namoWonder: That seem stable
4/16/22, 4:01 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , how is the road?

4/16/22, 4:07 PM - namoWonder: I told ya laughing is a language to communicate
4/16/22, 4:08 PM - namoWonder: Italians are the European Arabs man , they laugh and talk so loud
4/16/22, 4:11 PM - AmineF0: I can imagine that
4/16/22, 4:12 PM - AmineF0: Italians are a special kind of human
4/16/22, 4:14 PM - namoWonder: And they are here just for the food

4/28/22, 8:09 PM - namoWonder: Ay it's a bunch of like negativity but man idk how I'm thaaaaat positive and happy about everything I hope this happens to you , whenever some shit comes up you just laugh at it and don't go down at all
4/28/22, 8:11 PM - namoWonder: Like I missed 3 meetings , I missed the last interview I'm supposed to pass to have my contract to Germany and then that exam I failed it tho with 1 point AGAIN , my mom told me her divorce will start next month and bla bla
4/28/22, 8:11 PM - namoWonder: But man I don't know whyyy and how did I manage this hhhhhhh
4/28/22, 8:15 PM - AmineF0: Yeah i see , it must heavy to carry it with you everyday, but as you said , some positivity is necessary to endure
4/28/22, 8:15 PM - namoWonder: That's the thing
4/28/22, 8:16 PM - namoWonder: I don't feel it heavy
4/28/22, 8:16 PM - namoWonder: I learned that from a man in work
4/28/22, 8:16 PM - namoWonder: He has the the " do not give up on your youth "
4/28/22, 8:17 PM - namoWonder: Which is very kind you know , to be kind to yourself
4/28/22, 8:18 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , self care , that something u thought me
4/28/22, 8:18 PM - AmineF0: I used to burn myself out , or be the opposite: lazy . But there is a middle ground that can be reached with self care and actualization
4/28/22, 8:20 PM - namoWonder: For the damn real ???
4/28/22, 8:20 PM - namoWonder: You're the highlight of my evening hhhhh
4/28/22, 8:21 PM - namoWonder: Yeah , things won't be heavy like that, it will be fun to live and just go ahead
4/28/22, 8:21 PM - namoWonder: And somehow when you just accept all the shit and so on , things do actually work out for you
4/28/22, 8:23 PM - AmineF0: Yeah, how i see it is , it's necessary to have support in your life to overcome the stresses and challenges, but your support starts from you...
4/28/22, 8:24 PM - AmineF0: And when you notice that you are on the same team with yourself, you stop bossing yourself
4/28/22, 8:25 PM - namoWonder: We really are growing up
4/28/22, 8:26 PM - namoWonder: I like how learn from better humans wallah cool
4/28/22, 8:27 PM - AmineF0: "wallah cool" hhhhhh , I'm gonna start saying that
4/28/22, 8:27 PM - AmineF0: And it's true surrounding yourself with the right people is a game changer
4/28/22, 8:28 PM - namoWonder: Hhhhh wallah is veeery german , they say wallah in everything
4/28/22, 8:29 PM - namoWonder: Is it the best we can wish for something struggling tho ?

4/28/22, 8:30 PM - AmineF0: I don't know
4/28/22, 8:32 PM - AmineF0: But what i know is , dealing with things alone can sometimes be dangerous, sometimes a person is not in the right frame of mind to judge and his negative feelings can be distructive...
4/28/22, 8:33 PM - AmineF0: Having that pull you out of that stale water is necessary
4/28/22, 8:33 PM - AmineF0: Is stale a word wait

4/28/22, 8:35 PM - namoWonder: Isn't it ?
4/28/22, 8:35 PM - namoWonder: Stagnant maybe ?
4/28/22, 8:36 PM - namoWonder: Doesn't matter , we got it my mind cant add new words in any language
4/28/22, 8:39 PM - namoWonder: Dealing with shit alone is like looking for your own burial , outside pressure isn't that easy and it makes us lose youth way too early
4/28/22, 8:41 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
4/28/22, 8:42 PM - AmineF0: I don't know what is happening with the internet thought it is so weird
4/28/22, 8:42 PM - AmineF0: Though*
4/28/22, 8:42 PM - namoWonder: Maybe for a sec I think
4/28/22, 8:42 PM - namoWonder: No again not sending anything
4/28/22, 8:44 PM - namoWonder: Internet is being internet
4/28/22, 8:44 PM - namoWonder: Ah no now its good
4/28/22, 8:44 PM - AmineF0: Yeah so it's not only me
4/28/22, 8:44 PM - AmineF0: Anyway random things
4/28/22, 8:45 PM - AmineF0: Where were we
4/28/22, 8:45 PM - AmineF0: What a sentence

4/28/22, 8:45 PM - namoWonder: That's how germans speak hhhhhhh
4/28/22, 8:48 PM - AmineF0: Each language is a world
4/28/22, 8:48 PM - AmineF0: Ah it's gone again
4/28/22, 8:51 PM - AmineF0: Yeah WhatsApp is confirmed down
4/28/22, 8:47 PM - namoWonder: How is school going btw ?
4/28/22, 8:47 PM - namoWonder: Shall I call it university ? I'm not sure
4/28/22, 9:07 PM - AmineF0: And it's back
4/28/22, 9:07 PM - AmineF0: Technology
4/28/22, 9:08 PM - AmineF0: Fine, you know , human's mind is weird , it's all grey yet I'm most productive
4/28/22, 9:08 PM - AmineF0: It's just bittersweet
4/28/22, 9:09 PM - namoWonder: And again
4/28/22, 9:09 PM - namoWonder: And now it's completely gone
4/28/22, 9:09 PM - namoWonder: Bittersweet?
4/28/22, 9:11 PM - AmineF0: It's just you are neither happy nor sad , in between
4/28/22, 9:11 PM - AmineF0: You are happy when you succeed but it doesn't mean much
4/28/22, 9:12 PM - AmineF0: You are disappointed when you fail but it does not mean much too
4/28/22, 9:12 PM - namoWonder: But that what you ain't living any feeling ?
4/28/22, 9:13 PM - AmineF0: Not to that level , it's just just my feelings are "slow" and not powerful
4/28/22, 9:14 PM - AmineF0: Some kind of minor depression i guess but nothing really bad
4/28/22, 9:14 PM - namoWonder: U mean it's " fine "
4/28/22, 9:14 PM - AmineF0: Maybe it's a phase i don't know
4/28/22, 9:14 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
4/28/22, 9:15 PM - namoWonder: Not sure because it's the average
4/28/22, 9:15 PM - namoWonder: Not that we should live a roller-coaster of emotions but we gotta feel the most of it
4/28/22, 9:16 PM - namoWonder: But between happy and sad you must feel more like one
4/28/22, 9:17 PM - AmineF0: In an other description, it's just like you try to care for yourself and people you love , do ur tasks and ignore some of them and that's it. I can't even code , which is really unusual for me
4/28/22, 9:17 PM - AmineF0: Cooking does it for me but once a week
4/28/22, 9:18 PM - AmineF0: Maybe I'm just depressed in the sense that when they is a huge explosion, a depression follows naturally
4/28/22, 9:18 PM - AmineF0: But wait I'm sad all the time
4/28/22, 9:19 PM - AmineF0: Some kind of existential sadness , I'm not sad because of something, I'm just sad
4/28/22, 9:19 PM - AmineF0: I don't know , I'm still experiencing with this
4/28/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: You feel exhausted?
4/28/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: Very unusual actually , is it just the stress of studying?
4/28/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: What do u mean by sad ?? Like a constant sadness
4/28/22, 9:21 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
4/28/22, 9:21 PM - namoWonder: It must be something else but you explain it with sadness
4/28/22, 9:22 PM - namoWonder: Because it's easier
4/28/22, 9:22 PM - AmineF0: Anything can trigger me crying
4/28/22, 9:22 PM - AmineF0: Maybe

5/1/22, 4:17 PM - AmineF0: Take care
5/3/22, 9:58 PM - AmineF0: Hey
5/3/22, 9:58 PM - AmineF0: How are u
5/3/22, 9:59 PM - AmineF0: I'm not taking too much of your time , but i have a quick question if u are free or whenever u are.
5/3/22, 9:59 PM - AmineF0: Well we met and u saw me, what do u think ? Well the question is always "weirding" people , but i just need an opinion from an external perspective. In other words what are the things I can or should work on from your experience...
5/3/22, 9:59 PM - AmineF0: Maybe i ask the question too bluntly hhh
5/3/22, 10:07 PM - namoWonder: Hii , gimme 5 min
5/3/22, 10:08 PM - namoWonder: Oh well
5/3/22, 10:10 PM - namoWonder: The thing is i already know u so m okay and comfy with whatever ur doing , I know Im safe and like okay with u hhhhh
5/3/22, 10:10 PM - namoWonder: But if I remove the idea that I know u and just think like any human who's meet u
5/3/22, 10:16 PM - namoWonder: U should be more physically comfy with people , i know they are limits ofc but ppl to tend to be more open when you're closer and open physically but not in an annoying way tho
5/3/22, 10:16 PM - namoWonder: You're good with talking I don't see why having a Convo may be hard
5/3/22, 10:18 PM - namoWonder: Ah im thinking moment
5/3/22, 10:24 PM - namoWonder: Yes what I'd advice u is , don't wait till people cross ur cicle if u feel like u want to join an atmosphere just try to fit in
5/3/22, 10:25 PM - namoWonder: We don't always have to keep the distance , break the line and that trust me won't hurt u as an introvert
5/3/22, 10:29 PM - AmineF0: Yeah i can see that
5/3/22, 10:29 PM - namoWonder: And that's all I can think about
5/3/22, 10:29 PM - namoWonder: If I feel like anything to say I will tell u immediately
5/3/22, 10:31 PM - AmineF0: Yeah tnx , that is really appreciated
5/3/22, 10:33 PM - namoWonder: Yes sure anytime hhhhh
5/3/22, 10:33 PM - AmineF0: Yeah , I should think more abt that...
5/3/22, 10:33 PM - namoWonder: How are ya doing with the holidays
5/3/22, 10:34 PM - namoWonder: If u need any advice or something feel free to share
5/3/22, 10:34 PM - AmineF0: Yeah i will try to
5/3/22, 10:35 PM - AmineF0: The thing I really liked about the meet is how u made it easy for me , i felt most of the time comfortable (i had moments when I have become stressed or nervous but they were bits)
5/3/22, 10:36 PM - AmineF0: And being comfortable made me able to focus my intellectual energy and i was able to notice some things in my behavior, which is really eye opening
5/3/22, 10:39 PM - namoWonder: You were calm and comfy it's like water once its calm you see your reflection in it and that's what happened
5/3/22, 10:40 PM - namoWonder: Because I remember the first meet and then I got to know u better and I'm an extrovert so mix it all and boom i found a way to make it easier for both of us to enjoy it
5/3/22, 10:42 PM - namoWonder: But let's say I wasn't comfy or so , in that case u have to break your circle to make me feel  safe so as I can find a way to communicate with you
5/3/22, 10:44 PM - AmineF0: Yeah, that's why I'm trying to learn
5/3/22, 10:44 PM - AmineF0: It's gonna take time and practice, but I'm trying to get there
5/3/22, 10:46 PM - namoWonder: If u master how to break ur circle to make someone comfy youll be able to protect yourself as an introvert
5/3/22, 10:46 PM - namoWonder: For exemple in work I can make the most stubborn bad hard serious guy feel comfy to share anything with me and I will make it impossible for the light nice persons to communicate with me
5/3/22, 10:47 PM - namoWonder: Each one has its way to create an environment
5/3/22, 10:48 PM - AmineF0: I'm so amazed it's inspiring
5/3/22, 10:51 PM - AmineF0: And btw did u notice at some point me being "agressive" (not intentionally though).  This is something i have noticed through people's reaction at times , it's like sometimes I do something unconsciously that makes me look threatening or make them feel unwelcomed ...
5/3/22, 10:53 PM - namoWonder: Aggressive ? Are you about that word ?
5/3/22, 10:53 PM - AmineF0: I can't really pinpoint what it is or how
5/3/22, 10:53 PM - AmineF0: Yeah
5/3/22, 10:53 PM - namoWonder: Physically ?
5/3/22, 10:54 PM - namoWonder: There is the thing that you block people or so
5/3/22, 10:54 PM - namoWonder: But that's not aggressive
5/3/22, 10:55 PM - namoWonder: They feel like you're not into what you're doing whatever is that but that's just ur way to keep safety as I noticed
5/3/22, 10:55 PM - namoWonder: After sometime they will feel welcome
5/3/22, 10:56 PM - namoWonder: The thing with people they want to be accepted from the first sight which is not always faisable
5/3/22, 10:56 PM - namoWonder: I forgot the word in English again hhhhhh
5/3/22, 10:58 PM - AmineF0: I see , this sounds like some kind of therapy hhh
5/3/22, 10:59 PM - AmineF0: I really appreciate it , u know , it's rare chance to meet someone that gives the opportunity
5/3/22, 10:59 PM - AmineF0: How are u btw , work tomorrow?
5/3/22, 11:01 PM - namoWonder: Because I was given the opportunity too so I try to do the same
5/3/22, 11:01 PM - namoWonder: But do not always create a comfy environment tho , it's not always worth it
5/3/22, 11:02 PM - namoWonder: I'm goood back to normal life after Ramadan
5/3/22, 11:02 PM - namoWonder: And yes working tomorrow but still early to sleep tho a bit
5/3/22, 11:05 PM - AmineF0: For sure
5/3/22, 11:06 PM - AmineF0: Aahhh we gonna miss it
5/3/22, 11:07 PM - namoWonder: U cant imagine how many times I heard that today
5/3/22, 11:10 PM - AmineF0: That's a common thing , i know hhh
5/3/22, 11:19 PM - AmineF0: I ran off words hhh, i am gonna go read on how to ask the right questions (i should finish just listen)
5/3/22, 11:19 PM - AmineF0: Anyway , if u wanna talk abt something I'm open to it
5/3/22, 11:20 PM - AmineF0: And i wish good health (boomer wish hhh) and take care
5/3/22, 11:27 PM - namoWonder: Sorry for late reply I had a call
